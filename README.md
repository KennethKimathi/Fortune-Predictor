Fortune-Predictor

This script is part of a private project where I attempted to predict the profits of Fortune-500 companies based on different factors. 
In this script, I only show how I assess feature importance, to determine which features had the largest influence on profits. The output looks as follows: 

1. This is the terminal Output with values:

After defining the features, the prediction was done, and below is a representation of how accurate the model was in comparison to the actual values of the selected companies:
